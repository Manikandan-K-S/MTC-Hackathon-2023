## Features
- Dynamic Website: Our website provides an interactive platform where users can explore various engaging activities, test their knowledge about sustainable practices, and learn about the significance of reducing carbon emissions.

- Carbon Emission Calculator: We've integrated a user-friendly carbon emission calculator that allows users to assess their personal carbon footprint based on their daily habits and activities. This feature aims to raise awareness about individual contributions to carbon emissions.

- Engaging Challenges: To encourage proactive participation in the mission for a greener environment, our website hosts a series of challenging yet fun tasks that users can complete to earn rewards, badges, or simply contribute to environmental awareness.

- Dumpy Chatbot: Dumpy, our NLU-powered chatbot, is a valuable resource for Madurai residents. By providing ward-specific information, including the names and contact details of sanitary inspectors, users can easily report issues related to waste management and cleanliness, fostering a cleaner city.
